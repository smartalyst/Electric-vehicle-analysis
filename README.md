## Introduction
This is a power bi project on "analysis of electric vehicle".The project is to analyse and derive insights to answer crucial business questions,so as to take data driven decision. 

_*Disclaimer*_: _All datasets do not represent any company,institution,organization or country,it's a dummy data gotten from kaggle and use to test the capability of power bi_.

## Skills/concept demontrated
The following power bi features were incorporated:
- DAX
- Quick measures
- Drop down
- Filter
- Slicers
  
## Modelling
Their is no model because it's one table

## Visualization
The report comprises of 6 KPI'S  and 5 chart.

## Analysis
Total electric vehicle is 150k,while the Average Electric range is 68.

---
#### BEV(Battery Electric Vehicle):
Total electric vehicle for BEV is 117k and the % of BEV Vehicle is 78%.

---
#### PHEV(Plug-in hybrid Electric Vehicle):
Total electric vehicle for PHEV is 34k and the % of PHEV is 22%.

---
#### Total Vehicles by model year:
Year 2023 had highest total vehicle of 37k by model.

---
#### Total Vehicles by State:
WA had highest total vehicle of 150k by State.

---
#### Total Vehicles by make:
TESLA had highest total vehicle of 69k by Make.

---
#### Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility:
18k vehicles were not eligible due to low battery range,this is 11.8% of the total vehicle(150k).

Eligibility of 70k vehicles is unknown because battery range has not been researched, this make 46% of the total vehicle(150k).

63k vehicles were  eligible,this makes 41.8% of the total vehicle(150k).

---
#### Total Vehicles by Model:
MODEL Y had highest total vehicle of 29k .
